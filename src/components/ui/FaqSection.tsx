  {
    question: "What comes with the subscription?",
    answer: "Our subscription includes a premium sonic electric toothbrush, a charging base, a travel case, and quarterly replacement brush heads. The brush features multiple cleaning modes, a 30-day battery life, and smart timing functionality. Each quarterly shipment also includes biodegradable floss picks and our signature mint-flavored toothpaste."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel or pause anytime?",
    answer: "Absolutely! You have complete control over your subscription. You can pause, cancel, or modify your plan at any time through your account dashboard or by contacting our customer support team. There are no cancellation fees or long-term commitments. We want our members to stay because they love the service, not because they're locked in."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you accept dental insurance?",
    answer: "While our subscription is not typically covered by dental insurance, many of our customers use their HSA or FSA accounts to pay for their membership. Additionally, some of our premium plans include discounts on dental services that can complement your existing insurance coverage. We're happy to provide an itemized receipt if you'd like to submit a claim to your insurance provider."
  },
  {
    question: "How often do I get new brush heads?",
    answer: "New brush heads are automatically shipped to you every 3 months, which is the recommended replacement schedule by dental professionals. Each shipment is timed perfectly so you'll always have a fresh brush head when you need it. If you need extra brush heads, you can easily add them to your subscription through your account dashboard."
