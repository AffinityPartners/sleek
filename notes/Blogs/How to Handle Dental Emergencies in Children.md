Accidents happen, especially with active children. Whether it’s a fall at the playground or a sudden toothache, knowing how to handle a child’s dental emergency can prevent further damage and relieve pain quickly. Here’s what every parent should know about managing common dental emergencies.

What Counts as a Dental Emergency?
A dental emergency in children includes:
Knocked out or loose teeth (permanent or baby teeth)

Broken, chipped or cracked teeth
Severe toothaches or infections
Severe toothaches or infections
Bleeding from the mouth or gums
Objects stuck between the teeth
Injuries to the tongue, lips or cheeks
What to Do in Common Dental Emergencies
Knocked-Out Permanent Tooth

Find the tooth and hold it by the crown (not the root).
Rinse gently with water (do not scrub or remove tissue).
Try to reinsert the tooth into the socket. If that’s not possible, store it in milk or saliva.
See a dentist immediately- time is critical.
Knocked-Out Baby Tooth

Do not try to reinsert it. Baby teeth should not be forced back in.
Control bleeding with gauze and apply a cold compress.
See a dentist to ensure no damage to permanent teeth.
Chipped or Broken Tooth

Save the broken piece if possible.
Rinse the mouth with warm water.
Apply a cold compress to reduce swelling.
Visit the dentist to assess the damage.
Severe Toothache

Rinse with warm salt water to soothe pain.
Check for food debris between teeth and remove it gently with floss.
Apply a cold compress to the cheek if there’s swelling.
Do NOT put aspirin directly on the gums- it can cause irritation.
Schedule a dentist visit ASAP.
Object Stuck Between the Teeth

Use dental floss (not a sharp object like needles) to gently remove it.
If it won’t come out, visit a dentist.
Preventing Dental Emergencies in Kids
While some accidents are unavoidable, you can reduce risks by:

Ensuring your child wears a mouthguard for sports.
Avoid hard foods like ice, popcorn cornels, and hard candy.
Encourage good oral hygiene to prevent infections.
Child-proofing your home to reduce fall risks.
When to See a Dentist vs. Emergency Room
Go to the dentist for most dental injuries, toothaches, and chipped teeth.
Visit the ER for jaw fractures, excessive bleeding, or head injuries along with dental trauma.
Dental emergencies can be scary, but quick action can save your child’s smile. Having a plan in place ensures you’ll respond calmly and effectively. Keep your dentist’s emergency number handy and schedule regular checkups to maintain your child’s oral health.
