When it comes to nutrition, it’s important to take note that it greatly affects our oral health. What we eat and drink plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy teeth and gums. We’re shining a light on ten foods and drinks that might surprise you with their oral health benefits.

1. Yogurt, Milk and Cheeses
Dairy products are well-known for being rich in calcium, which is essential for strong bones and teeth. Yogurts and cheeses are particularly beneficial as they are soft, making them gentle on sensitive teeth, while still packing a nutrient punch. Milk, too, provides calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus- important components for tooth remineralization and enamel health.

2. Spinach
Dark, leafy greens, like spinach, are loaded with iron, calcium, and folic acid, all of which contribute to overall health, including your oral well-being. Calcium in spinach helps rebuild tooth enamel, making it a fantastic addition to your diet. Other dark greens like kale and collard greens offer similar benefits.

3. Almonds
Almonds are a great low-sugar snack that promotes oral health. They are rich in calcium and protein, which strengthens teeth and gums. Avoiding sugar is key to lowering the acidity in your mouth, thus preventing enamel erosion.

4. Salmon
Salmon is a powerhouse of nutrients, particularly vitamin D, which helps your body absorb calcium more effectively. Protein in salmon also helps repair and strengthen gum tissue. Including salmon in your diet ensures that your teeth stay strong, and your gums stay healthy.

5. Carrots
Raw carrots are not only delicious but also beneficial for your teeth. Their crunchy texture acts like a natural toothbrush, helping to remove food particles and clean your teeth. Carrots are also rich in vitamin A, which supports enamel repair.

6. Lean Meat
Lean meats, such as chicken, provide a good source of protein and phosphorus, both vital for oral health. Phosphorus is important for bone and tooth health as it works in conjunction with calcium to strengthen teeth and prevent fractures or chips.

7. Celery
Celery chares similar benefits to carrots, acting as a natural toothbrush and promoting gum health. It also contains vitamin K, which helps transport calcium to the bones and teeth, strengthening them. Chewing celery increases saliva production, which helps keep your mouth clean and healthy.

8. Green Tea/Black Tea
If you’re a tea lover, you’ll be pleased to know that green and black teas can aid in oral health. These teas are free of sugar (as long as you don’t add any) and help reduce acidity in the mouth, promoting a healthy pH balance. Tea also contains natural fluoride, which strengthens tooth enamel.

9. Apples
Like carrots, apples can help clean your teeth when eaten raw, though to a lesser extent. They are low-acid fruit, which is a bonus for your enamel, unlike high-acid fruits like oranges, which can erode teeth over time.

10. Still Water
Water remains the best drink for both your body and your teeth. It helps wash away bacteria, neutralizes mouth acidity, and aids in saliva production. Drinking plenty of water throughout the day is one of the easiest ways to maintain good oral hygiene.

Conclusion
Incorporating a diet rich in calcium, vitamin D, and low-acid foods can lead to healthier teeth and gums. Pair these dietary choices with regular dental care for the best results.
